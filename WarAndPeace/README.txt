How to run this project:
This is a .NET project written in C#.
To start, navigate to the project folder "WarAndPeace" and run the command "dotnet run".

You should then see console output such as "Inserting words" and "Merging trees".
When the progress bar is full, all words were successfully inserted into the tree (functionally, of course).
Then, you should see the list of words in order and the time elapsed for the tokenization of words and insterting into the tree.

If the console output seems to be stuck, press Enter.
